        <!-- Introduction: what is ChatGPT and generative AI -->
        <section id="understanding">
            <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
            <p>Generative AI models such as ChatGPT are built on large language models and can generate human‑like text. These tools are transforming the workplace. Research by the OpenAI Initiative estimates that around 80 % of the U.S. workforce could have at least one‑tenth of their tasks affected by large language models, and about 19 % could see at least half of their tasks impacted. At present generative AI is primarily used to augment human work—users must decide what they want to know, create a prompt and then review and edit the resulting text.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Benefits section -->
        <section id="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits and Efficiency Gains</h2>
            <p>AI tools can help employees develop ideas, summarize text and even generate code. When used responsibly they can streamline workflows and free time for human creativity. Surveys show that many workers view AI as a coworker rather than a threat: 64 % of employees who personally derived value from AI were over three times more likely to be satisfied at work, and a high percentage of workers whose organizations benefited from AI also reported personal benefits.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Risks section -->
        <section id="risks">
            <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
            <p>Despite the advantages, generative AI introduces privacy and security concerns. When you send a prompt to a chatbot, the data may no longer belong to you and can be stored by the provider. Even if chat history is turned off, prompts are kept on external servers, where hackers or software bugs could expose them. Inputting client data or confidential documents into ChatGPT can inadvertently leak sensitive information. In 2023, for example, a Samsung engineer’s internal source code appeared in ChatGPT responses, prompting the company to ban generative AI tools; Amazon warned employees to use such tools cautiously after similar incidents.</p>

        <!-- Best practices section -->
        <section id="best-practices">
            <h2>Best Practices for Control Cutter Staff</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Never include names, addresses, financials or proprietary data in prompts.</li>
                <li>Anonymize queries by removing personal or client information and use general descriptions.</li>
                <li>Avoid uploading confidential documents or source code; summarizing sensitive data via chatbots can expose company secrets.</li>
                <li>Develop clear, specific prompts and always verify the output. Generative AI can hallucinate or produce inaccurate information; employees should critically review and edit results.</li>
                <li>Receive training on AI tools and understand how they work, what problems they can cause and how to guard against them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <!-- ChatGPT Agent Mode section -->
        <section id="agent-mode">
            <h2>ChatGPT Agent Mode</h2>
            <p>In July 2025 OpenAI introduced agentic capabilities to ChatGPT. The ChatGPT agent combines browsing tools, code execution and API access, enabling the model to autonomously complete complex, multi‑step tasks on a virtual computer. It unifies previous technologies like Deep Research and Operator so that an agent can browse websites, execute code, call APIs and even generate images within a secure sandbox.</p>
            <p>Safety features ensure that the agent asks for permission before taking consequential actions, and there is a takeover mode for user oversight. Agentic functionality moves beyond chat assistance to autonomous task execution, but staff should remain vigilant and provide clear objectives to avoid unintended actions.</p>
            <h3>Potential Uses &amp; Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Task execution: agents can carry out research, build spreadsheets and generate presentations without switching tools.</li>
                <li>Multi‑tool integration: browsing, code execution, API connectors and file manipulation are available in one system.</li>
                <li>Administrative assistance: agents can handle scheduling, email management and other routine tasks while keeping humans in the loop.</li>
                <li>Data and analytics: automate analysis and reporting of large datasets to support informed decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although agent mode increases productivity, control cutter staff must monitor outputs and prevent the agent from performing actions that could breach privacy or data security.</p>
        </section>
        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Generative AI is changing workplaces by augmenting tasks and improving efficiency. However, it also introduces new risks. Control cutter staff should leverage ChatGPT and similar tools responsibly by understanding the technology, protecting confidential data and verifying outputs. By following best practices, employees can harness the benefits of AI while maintaining safety, privacy and quality in their work.</p>
